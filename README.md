Personal Biometrics Project

This project explores patterns in personal biometric data collected over a set period, focusing on metrics such as heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate (RHR), step count, and body weight. The aim was to identify trends, relationships, and potential early indicators of changes in overall health status.

Data analysis included descriptive statistics, time-series visualizations, and correlation assessments to examine how these metrics vary over time and interact with one another. The project emphasizes observational insights without making causal claims, providing a foundation for further exploration into how biometric patterns may reflect physical activity, recovery, and general well-being.
